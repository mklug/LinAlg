# LinAlg

This repository contains some [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) which illustrate some of the concepts for the "Abstract Linear Algebra" class that I am teaching (in an effort to make these concepts less abstract).  The scripts are written in python.  We will use [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) which is a python scientific computation library that in particular has a linear algebra library that meets our needs.  For visualizations, we will use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

The scripts are just to get you started.  Ideally, you will have fun modifying/extending the ideas, formulating some conjectures, gaining some intuition, and possibly proving some of your conjectures.
